# LeagueMode
This is a neat little tool i have been using while playing League of Legends. It is a batch script that opens 3 useful websites to have open alongside the game:

Professor.gg (To get general information about both teams while loading into the game)

Op.gg (To track your own progress throughout games)

U.gg (To view current builds for any champion)


How to setup:
1. 🖱️Right click on the .bat file
2. ❌Replace `<Username here>` with your own summoner name
3. 💾Save the file
4. 🖱️Right click on the file and hit "Create shortcut"
  
🥳🥳Now you have a shortcut you can place anywhere you'd like. I have mine positioned in my toolbar for easy access 🥳🥳

 You can now start using the script, or you can take further steps to stylize the shortcut:
1. 🖱️Right click on the shortcut
2. 🖱️Click "properties" -> "Change Icon" -> "Browse..."
4. 🔎Locate Leaguemode.Ico downloaded from this repo
5. ✔️Hit 'Ok' to apply changes

🎉🎉And now you're done, enjoy :)🎉🎉
